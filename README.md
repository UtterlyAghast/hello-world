Getting used to github

Uhh I like to learn about different areas of study and other peoples hobbies, I suppose you can say im a nerd, 

Programming will probably be one of the things I learn about, I don't know how long or how deeply but i've always liked this field from the outside so i'm going to at least put more effort than just a regular hobby.

Some personal things about myself:
- I study philosophy, not professionally or as a part of my education but more as a genuine interest and deeper hobby.

- I just absolutely suck at math, i'm more of a words person (apart from symbolic logic in philosophy), I just could never grasp topics like others could, I'd love to learn ways to understand math though (note to self: should probably learn more about maths).

- Turtles, bats, octopuses and most lazy animals are my favourite animals, they just live life being chill.

- I'm a jazz and classical music guy, specifically violent/emotion-filled classical pieces and most types of jazz. (though I will listen to good music of any kind I neeed recommendations)
